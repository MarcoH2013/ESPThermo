ESP8266 based thermometer for BBQ

As perhaps many of us, I would like to combine my passion for technology with the passion of barbecuing.
The idea to build a digital thermometer itself, I got from many different projects on the website www.grillsportverein.de.
Most of the projects based on a RPI which I see as oversized for this simple task.
That's why I started to experiment with an ESP8266.
